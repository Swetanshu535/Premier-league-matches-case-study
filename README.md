Premier league matches case study contains dashboard made from the dataset

I recently had the opportunity to dive into a fascinating Premier League matches case study, working with an intriguing dataset that contains key information about the matches. The dataset includes columns such as ID, date, round, day, venue, result, opponent, captain, shot, sot value (shots on target), distance, free kicks (fk), and penalty kicks (pk). With this data, I performed several analyses and visualizations, which culminated in an interactive dashboard.

Some of the key questions I focused on include displaying the total number of rounds played, as it’s essential to know how many matches took place. Another insightful analysis was determining the total number of unique captains throughout the dataset—providing a deeper look into the leadership across different teams.

To further explore the performance metrics, I examined the total number of shots made by each round, giving a clearer view of how offensive strategies varied. I also analyzed the total distances covered by captains, reflecting their physical contribution during the matches. This metric is valuable as it highlights how certain players take the lead in not just tactics but also physical exertion.

A deeper dive into penalties was achieved by showcasing the total number of penalty kicks (pk) taken by different opponents, providing an understanding of which teams are more prone to giving away or earning penalties. Furthermore, I examined the "shots on target" (sot) for each day of the matches, helping to pinpoint the precision and efficiency of teams during specific days.

These insights, derived from the data, were used to create an engaging dashboard that presents a holistic view of the Premier League matches. The visualization is not just a summary of the statistics but an interactive tool that allows users to explore different aspects of the game, from player performance to team strategies.

I’m excited about the potential of this project and the power of data to reveal stories hidden within sports statistics. This case study was a great exercise in applying data analysis techniques to real-world events, and I’m looking forward to more projects like this!
